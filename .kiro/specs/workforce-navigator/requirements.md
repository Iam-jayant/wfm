# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WorkForce Navigator is a Mappls-powered platform designed to automate and optimize field workforce operations for electronic utility companies. The platform leverages Mappls's comprehensive APIs and SDKs for real-time mapping, geofencing, routing, and offline support to transform manual, error-prone processes into a smart, data-driven workflow. The MVP aims to save time, reduce operational costs, and boost customer satisfaction through intelligent workforce management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Workforce Tracking

**User Story:** As a field operations manager, I want to see real-time locations of all field employees on an interactive map, so that I can monitor workforce distribution and respond quickly to operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is accessed THEN it SHALL display a Mappls-based interactive map showing all active field workers
2. WHEN a field worker's mobile device is active THEN the system SHALL update their location on the map every 30 seconds or less
3. WHEN a manager clicks on a worker marker THEN the system SHALL display worker details including name, current task, and last update time
4. IF a worker's location hasn't updated for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL display a warning indicator
5. WHEN viewing the map THEN managers SHALL be able to filter workers by status, team, or assigned tasks

### Requirement 2: Geofenced Attendance & Auto-Check-In/Check-Out

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want the system to automatically log my attendance when I enter or exit job sites, so that I don't have to manually track my time and can focus on my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a geofence is created for a job site THEN the system SHALL define a circular or polygonal boundary with configurable radius
2. WHEN a worker enters a designated geofenced area THEN the system SHALL automatically log check-in time with location coordinates
3. WHEN a worker exits a geofenced area THEN the system SHALL automatically log check-out time with location coordinates
4. IF a worker is within multiple geofences THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most specific or recently assigned job site
5. WHEN auto-check-in/out occurs THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation notification to the worker
6. WHEN geofence events are triggered THEN the system SHALL store timestamp, location, and worker ID for audit purposes

### Requirement 3: Job/Task Assignment Dashboard

**User Story:** As a field operations manager, I want to assign and reassign jobs to the nearest available workers with one click, so that I can optimize resource allocation and minimize response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the assignment dashboard THEN managers SHALL see a list of pending jobs and available workers
2. WHEN a new job is created THEN the system SHALL suggest the three nearest available workers based on current location
3. WHEN a manager assigns a job THEN the system SHALL send immediate notification to the selected worker
4. WHEN a job needs reassignment THEN managers SHALL be able to transfer it to another worker with one click
5. WHEN jobs are assigned THEN the system SHALL update worker status and display assignment on the map
6. IF no workers are available within a configurable radius THEN the system SHALL alert the manager and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 4: Route Optimization

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want to receive optimized routes to my assigned locations, so that I can minimize travel time and complete more jobs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker receives a job assignment THEN the system SHALL calculate the optimal route using Mappls Routing API
2. WHEN calculating routes THEN the system SHALL consider real-time traffic conditions to minimize travel time
3. WHEN multiple jobs are assigned to one worker THEN the system SHALL optimize the sequence to create the most efficient route
4. WHEN route optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL display estimated travel time and distance
5. IF traffic conditions change significantly THEN the system SHALL recalculate and suggest alternative routes
6. WHEN workers follow optimized routes THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 30% reduction in average travel time

### Requirement 5: Digital Timesheets

**User Story:** As a payroll administrator, I want automated timesheet generation from location logs, so that I can eliminate manual entry errors and prevent time fraud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN geofence check-in/out events occur THEN the system SHALL automatically populate digital timesheets
2. WHEN generating timesheets THEN the system SHALL calculate total hours worked per job site and per day
3. WHEN timesheets are created THEN they SHALL include location verification data and timestamps
4. IF there are gaps or anomalies in location data THEN the system SHALL flag entries for manual review
5. WHEN timesheet periods end THEN the system SHALL generate reports for payroll processing
6. WHEN workers or managers need to make corrections THEN the system SHALL provide an approval workflow for timesheet modifications

### Requirement 6: Notification System

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want to receive timely notifications about job assignments and updates, so that I can stay informed and respond appropriately to changing priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are assigned or reassigned THEN workers SHALL receive push notifications within 10 seconds
2. WHEN job status changes are required THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications
3. WHEN urgent situations arise THEN managers SHALL be able to send priority alerts to specific workers or teams
4. IF push notifications fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to SMS delivery
5. WHEN workers are approaching shift end THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications about pending tasks
6. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL log delivery status and allow read receipts

### Requirement 7: Expense & Travel Reimbursement Automation

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want my travel expenses to be automatically calculated based on my actual routes, so that I can receive accurate reimbursement without manual paperwork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workers travel between job sites THEN the system SHALL track actual routes using Mappls route data
2. WHEN calculating reimbursements THEN the system SHALL use configurable mileage rates and expense categories
3. WHEN expense reports are generated THEN they SHALL include detailed route information and timestamps
4. IF personal trips are mixed with work travel THEN the system SHALL allow workers to mark segments as non-reimbursable
5. WHEN expense calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports compatible with existing payroll systems
6. WHEN discrepancies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag unusual patterns for manager review

### Requirement 8: Blockchain-Based Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all critical workforce events to be stored on an immutable blockchain ledger, so that I can ensure data integrity and provide transparent audit trails for regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timesheet events occur (check-in/out) THEN the system SHALL store event hashes on the Ethereum blockchain within 30 seconds
2. WHEN expense claims are submitted THEN the system SHALL create blockchain records with route verification data
3. WHEN job assignments are made or completed THEN the system SHALL log these events to the blockchain for audit purposes
4. IF blockchain storage fails THEN the system SHALL queue events for retry and continue normal operations
5. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide blockchain transaction hashes for verification
6. WHEN data integrity is questioned THEN authorized users SHALL be able to verify any event against its blockchain record
7. WHEN storing blockchain events THEN the system SHALL optimize for gas costs by batching non-urgent events
8. IF blockchain network congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL use Layer 2 solutions or delay non-critical events
